# Dating-Persona-Mapping-MCA-and-Clustering-for-User-Profiling-with-prince-package-

This project explores the application of data analysis and clustering techniques to the Tinder dataset. The aim is to uncover patterns and groupings 
within the dataset using dimensionality reduction (MCA) and clustering methods. By leveraging these methods, we aim to demonstrate skills in data preprocessing, 
exploratory data analysis (EDA), and unsupervised learning techniques.

KEY OBJECTIVES

Data Exploration:
Understand the structure of the Tinder dataset.
Identify patterns and relationships between features.

Data Preprocessing:
Handle missing values.
Rename columns for clarity

Dimensionality Reduction:
Apply Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA) to reduce the dataset's dimensionality while retaining significant relationships between categorical variables.

Clustering:
Implement clustering methods suitable for categorical data.
Evaluate clustering performance using appropriate metrics.

Visualization:
Visualize MCA-transformed data and clustering results for better interpretability.


TOOLS & TECHNOLOGIES

Programming Language: Python

Libraries:
Data Analysis: Pandas, NumPy
Visualization: Matplotlib
Machine Learning: scikit-learn, prince (for MCA)
