# Dating-Persona-Mapping-and-Clustering-for-User-Profiling

This project explores the application of data analysis and clustering techniques to the Tinder dataset. The aim is to uncover patterns and groupings 
within the dataset using dimensionality reduction (MCA) and clustering methods. By leveraging these methods, we aim to demonstrate skills in data preprocessing, 
exploratory data analysis (EDA), and unsupervised learning techniques.


KEY OBJECTIVES

Data Exploration; Data Preprocessing; Dimensionality Reduction; Clustering; Visualization.
